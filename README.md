![Database Tables](assets/images/database_tables.png)

> **How to add your image:**  
> 1. Place the ERD or table diagram in your project folder, e.g., `assets/images/database_tables.png`.  
> 2. Make sure the path exists in `pubspec.yaml` under `flutter/assets`. Example:  
> ```yaml
> flutter:
>   assets:
>     - assets/images/database_tables.png
> ```  
> 3. Use Markdown `![Alt Text](path/to/image.png)` to show it in README.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Order Lifecycle
1. Customer sends a service request
2. Crafter sees it in **New Requests**
3. Crafter can:
   - Accept ‚Üí Status becomes **In Progress**
   - Reject ‚Üí Status becomes **Rejected**
4. Crafter completes work ‚Üí Status becomes **Completed**
5. **Progress Indicator** updates automatically

### Progress Indicator
- Shows ratio of completed vs total orders for the crafter
- Updates dynamically when order status changes
- Uses `Selector` from Provider for efficient UI updates

### Deep Link Handling
- Listens for password reset links and OAuth callbacks
- Opens appropriate screens automatically
- Uses `app_links` and `shared_preferences` to handle links only once
